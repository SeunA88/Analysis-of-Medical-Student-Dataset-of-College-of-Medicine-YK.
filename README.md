## Introduction
This analysis entails datasets of medical students from the College of Medicine, YK. It includes attributes of about 200,000 medical students such as Student ID, Age, Gender, Height, Weight, Blood Type, BMI, Temperature, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Diabetes and smoking spread out into individual columns. 

Kindly feel free to interact with data here...(https://github.com/SeunA88/Analysis-of-Medical-Students-Dataset-of-College-of-Medicine-YK./blob/main/Med_student_initial_data.xlsx).

Analysis of this data was carried out to acquire some useful insights from the dataset. Firstly, each column was formatted to depict the data therein. The following insights were obtained from the data using Pivot tables in Excel:

1. 	Average Cholesterol, Heart rate, Blood pressure, Age, Temperature, BMI, Weight, and Height of students.
2.	Average Height and Weight by Gender.
3.  Number of Students by Blood Type.
4.  Number of Students who smoke and those who don’t.
5.  Number of Students who have diabetes and those who don’t.

These acquired insights were further displayed with various visualization tools in Excel. Please find below each pivot table analysis alongside their visuals.
